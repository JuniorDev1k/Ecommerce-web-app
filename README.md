# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Project description. I developed a dynamic ecommerce web application specializing in gaming products using React for the frontend and Firebase for backend I implemented authentication (email and Google), Firestore for database design & logic, and Firebase Storage for image storage. Leveraging React hooks and Context API ensured efficient data fetching and state management. The application includes a comprehensive product page with advanced search and filtering system (by category, price, color), seamless user authentication flows, and product detail pages for enhanced user experience.
